Thank you for taking the time to explore my project, created during my sophomore year in AP Computer Science. This project was developed as part of my coursework, and it is important to note that it reflects my skills and understanding at that particular stage of my academic journey. As with any learning process, growth and improvement are ongoing, and this project represents a foundational step in my programming education.
